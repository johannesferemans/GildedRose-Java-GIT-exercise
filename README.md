Ik heb deze repository gemaakt voor de les projectmanagement om te leren werken met github.

# GIT Exercise
The goal of this repository is to create an exercise for students on learning GIT. They will add features and unit tests
for different products but also will have to create some changes in the main function for which it is important to avoid or resolve merge conflicts.
The code is based on the Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata. It is used in the class of 2021 as well.

# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose). See also [Bobby Johnson's description of the kata](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/).

As Bobby Johnson points out in his article ["Why Most Solutions to Gilded Rose Miss The Bigger Picture"](http://iamnotmyself.com/2012/12/07/why-most-solutions-to-gilded-rose-miss-the-bigger-picture), it'll actually give you
better practice at handling a legacy code situation if you do this Kata in the original C#. However, I think this kata
is also really useful for practicing writing good tests using different frameworks and approaches, and the small changes I've made help with that. I think it's also interesting to compare what the refactored code and tests look like in different programming languages.
